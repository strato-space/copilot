Findings: migration imports issues+labels+dependencies+events from SQLite, but does not preserve full history semantics. (1) It creates a single Dolt commit at migration time (cmd/bd/migrate_dolt.go:121-124), so pre-migration version/commit history is not reconstructable in Dolt history. (2) events are imported from events table only (cmd/bd/migrate_shim.go:279-303, cmd/bd/migrate_dolt.go:332-354) with no ORDER BY, then iterated via map in importer (cmd/bd/migrate_import.go:181-189), so strict event ordering is not guaranteed. (3) issue metadata JSON is not selected/inserted in migration SQL (cmd/bd/migrate_shim.go:206-237, cmd/bd/migrate_import.go:101-123).
